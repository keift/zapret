## What is Zapret?

Zapret is a lightweight tool designed to bypass DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) used by internet service providers to block access to certain websites. It works by modifying packet data in a way that prevents DPI systems from correctly identifying and filtering connections, allowing users to access blocked content more freely without a VPN. It’s popular among users in countries with restricted internet access, providing a straightforward and efficient solution to regain access to censored sites.
